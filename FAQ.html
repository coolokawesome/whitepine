                            make a drastic change or your tattoo without proper notice.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-title">How long will my tattoo take to heal?</h4>
                        <p>Usually it takes several weeks to have your tattoo fully healed. That’s why it’s important to
                            keep your tattoo and your personal environment clean and optimal for healing your wound. You
                            may want to kick kitty or doggy outta your bed until it’s a closed wound, as they are known
                            to carry bacteria and *poo* particles in their fur.
                        </p>
                        <p>It will be wise to reduce contact with
                            dangerous bacteria by not exposing your body to heat from saunas, going to the gym, going
                            swimming in lakes, pools, oceans and hot tubs, even baths. Try and avoid submerging for
                            prolonged periods in bodies of water. Let’s say you have a hand tattoo, try to avoid washing
                            hair if you’re a hair stylist or dog groomer and use your hands for work. Follow your
                            artists aftercare accordingly to ensure you have no problems once you leave the studio!

                        <h4 class="faq-title">Do you do cover-ups/rework other artists tattoos?</h4>
                        <p>In some cases, we accept cover ups usually if it’s faded/small. We also need you to trust us
                            twice as much and have an open mind and a great idea. Just email us and ensure you have a
                            clear photo and an open mind. We also sometimes can tattoo over scars if they’re
                            hypo-pigmented, not incredibly raised and over 2 years old. We operate on the base of
                            trauma-informed tattooing, and work sensitively with those with SH scars. Please email us!
                            We will also not touch another artists work unless they have moved provinces or countries,
                            or other circumstances, or if the client is truly unhappy with the result.

                        <p>We are working with needles, so yes! They can hurt. It feels like a cat scratching your fresh
                            sunburn. It also tends to get tender after a couple hours. But every body is different and
                            have different pain tolerances. Pain can be further minimized by ensuring you slept well,
                            ate, and stayed sober for your appointment.
                        </p>

                            Tattoos wouldn’t be as popular if they were unbearable. We will be offering Zensa numbing
                            products for your comfort if you’re wanting the tattoo without the extreme pain! Just let us
                            know I’m advance.

                        <p>They can fade if you expose them to sun when they’re brand new, or micro-exposures to the sun
                            are ways you can fade your tattoo and most likely will cause the image to blur and lose its
                            clarity and tone. Keep it protected with SPF!

                            appointment?</h4>
                        <p>Ensure you get a good nights rest the night before, stay hydrated, eat, avoid heavy sun for
                            two weeks before your appointment. Do not drink 24 hours before your appointment. Let your
                            artist know if you are using any sort of numbing agents before we start your tattoo. Wear
                            appropriate fitting clothing for your appointment. If you need suggestions there any many
                            online or you can ask your artist. Don’t wear a turtleneck the day of your neck tattoo!

                            We do not recommend you receiving a tattoo nursing or pregnant, our immune systems are considered immunosuppressed. If you receive an infection you could possibly pass it to baby, so It’s best to wait until you’ve back to optimal health before considering a tattoo.
